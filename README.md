<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

I wanted to easily create a SVG QR code, which was not easily possible with other open tools. This was a nice case for a shinylive app.

## Installation an example use

To use the package and run the shiny-app locally, you can install the development version of qr.live with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("agdamsbo/qr.live")
```

Launch the included shiny app with the following code:

``` r
library(qr.live)
shiny_qr()
```
